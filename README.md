## our idea

Having all your medical record stored at one place has always been a challenge, moreover they are more often not available at emergencies. So using uhack, We want to create an application that will store all medical records of the patient , digital copies of x-ray/ct scan, past medical history etc. at one unified database attached the user account through his/her Aadhaar card. Government agencies should be able to access all the medical history in case of emergencies (Like during accidents). Also any medical practitioner should be able to see the past list of injections that a user has taken and past medical history of his/her patient.


## our next 24hrs


Remotely share reports - Reports can be sent to a doctor without visiting the clinic again and again.

Share diet-chart easily with your family/cook

We plan to use google assistant to easily assist user through voice recognition tasks, also AWS Lambda to easily make it 

scalable + seamless performance as. We will also be using Blockchain technology to ensure security to it's best.

## New Idea , New Innovation And Complete Automation

## Bus Ticket Automate System (Ticket-omate)

No more headache of taking bus tickets  or taking the tention for the change . No longer waiting in queue maintaing your
balance against the inertia. Enter the bus have a seat and exit it. That's it  , Team Dexter will take care of all the 
rest .Using advance bluetooth enabled (BEACONS) smartcards we will recognize you and your bus-stand at your starting 
point as well as your destination and payments all through upi's . Ha  No Bus Conductor at all ! .You will  be 
verified  by  the random ticket checker's .but that's even very simple process of checking  , if you have
your smartcard and if it's in the active state that's it.

## Advantages

* No more papper and no more cash in hand.

* Very Fast and reaching high level of accuracy.

* No Bus Conductor Cost.

* Defines a complete new way of transit payment.

* Swift User Experience and smooth (butterly) process.

## Implementation
* BLE Beacon Sender 
   * at Bus Stop ( Device)
   * at user ( Card )
* BLE Beacon Reciever
   * in Bus

Beacon @Bus we will recieve signals of the beacon card of user . 

* Two checking process
    * User distance from the reciever . (If greater than 10m not in bus .)
    * User minimum stay time. (If not in range for less than  45 sec not took the bus.)
   
Beacon @Bus will recieve signals from the present bus stand and update it on the next stand.

The server at back will calculate the fair of individual user depending upon his initial and final bus stand .Initiate a payment
and amount will be debited from user account.
