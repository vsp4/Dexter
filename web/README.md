## our idea

Having all your medical record stored at one place has always been a challenge, moreover they are more often not available at emergencies. So using uhack, We want to create an application that will store all medical records of the patient , digital copies of x-ray/ct scan, past medical history etc. at one unified database attached the user account through his/her Aadhaar card. Government agencies should be able to access all the medical history in case of emergencies (Like during accidents). Also any medical practitioner should be able to see the past list of injections that a user has taken and past medical history of his/her patient..
